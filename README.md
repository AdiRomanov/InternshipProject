Project Documentation: Deploying a Web Application with CI/CD on GCP
Overview

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide on how to deploy a web application using a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The project involves Dockerizing the application, provisioning infrastructure with Terraform, deploying to a Kubernetes cluster using Ansible, and setting up a Load Balancer for external access.

Introduction

This project demonstrates the deployment of a web application to Google Cloud Platform using a CI/CD pipeline. It covers infrastructure provisioning, containerization, orchestration with Kubernetes, and monitoring. Key technologies include Docker, Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, Kubernetes Engine, and GCP Load Balancer.
Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

    Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account
    Docker Desktop installed
    Terraform installed
    Ansible installed
    Jenkins installed and configured
    Basic familiarity with Git and CI/CD concepts

Step 1: Set Up a Public Git Repository

    Create a public Git repository on GitHub or GitLab.
    Upload your web application code (HTML, CSS, JS) to the repository.

Step 2: Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform

    Install Terraform on your local machine.
    Write Terraform code to provision a GKE cluster and Cloud SQL database.
    Enable autoscaling for the GKE cluster.
    Configure VPC network settings and firewall rules.

Step 3: Dockerize and Deploy the Web Application to GKE

    Write a Dockerfile for the web application.
    Build and test the Docker image locally.
    Push the Docker image to Google Container Registry (GCR).
    Write Kubernetes manifest files for deployment.

Step 4: Implement CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins

    Install and configure Jenkins on a server.
    Create a Jenkins pipeline job for the Git repository.
    Define pipeline stages for build, test, and deployment.
    Use Ansible scripts in the pipeline to deploy to GKE.

Step 5: Networking and Security

    Set up HTTP(S) Load Balancers for GKE cluster.
    Implement SSL/TLS for secure communication.
    Configure firewall rules to allow outside access.

Step 6: Monitoring and Logging

    Set up Cloud Monitoring for GKE cluster.
    Configure log aggregation for GKE cluster.
    Store logs in Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

Step 7: Documentation

    Create a detailed README file in your Git repository.
    Document project architecture, components, and key technologies.
    Provide step-by-step instructions for setup and configuration.
    Explain deployment using the CI/CD pipeline.
    Include usage instructions for accessing the application.

Conclusion

By following this documentation, you've learned how to deploy a web application using a CI/CD pipeline on Google Cloud Platform. The project covers Dockerization, infrastructure provisioning, orchestration, and monitoring, helping you build and deploy applications with modern DevOps practices.
